    <h2>Artist’s Statement</h2>
    <p>Title: Swipe & Survive</P>
<p>For this project, I created a Twine game called “Swipe & Survive” explores the impact of daily social media use on mood, connection, and productivity. The games audience is towards college students who are around 18–21. This is a group that is well known to the digital life and usually balances academic performances, personal relationships, and digital distractions. The issue that I wanted to highlight is on how everyday life choices are related to screen time, (especially on platforms like Instagram or TikTok) can significantly influence our well-being without us realizing it. Rather than telling the player or create a clear “right vs. wrong” path, I designed the experience to reflect how tempting these digital decisions really are. Scrolling on your phone isn’t always bad. It can help it boost your mood or even helps you relax. But when you are on your phone for the majority of your time, it can pull you away from productivity, sleep, or even in-person connections. This game puts into perspective situations and problems that might affect a college students’ life. The story begins when the player wakes up and chooses how to start their day. For example, going for a run or checking notifications. These decisions affect five tracked variables: mood, focus, energy, screentime, and focus. Based on how those stats evolve throughout the day, the player reaches one of three endings: burned out, balanced, or disconnected. The goal of this game isn’t about “winning” but it’s to reflect on how your routine affects your mindset each day. If you hit Burned Out, it doesn’t mean you failed but it’s a realistic representation of what many students experience after a day spent multitasking online. When designing this game, I wanted to keep the game clean and familiar but visually engaging. I styled the game with custom CSS that uses soft colors, fonts that feel modern and accessible. I also let the player enter their own name at the beginning to create a warm welcome and a sense of personalization. This feature, along with the variable-s, helps turn a simple click-through story into a playable self-reflection. Next, the game uses 40 passages and more than 10 distinct Harlowe macros. For example: set, if, prompt, either, and display are some of the macros that I used. Using these helped keep the story together. The passage counts and structure copies the rhythm of a real day, morning, afternoon, and evening choices, with branching interruptions like text messages, study breaks, or calls from friends. I purposely avoided overly dramatic plot twists because the game is about realism and the day often unfolds when you're living through your phone. In conclusion, “Swipe & Survive” isn’t trying to shame or judge anyone. It’s about recognizing an issue many of us deal with on a daily basis so we can spread more of an awareness. If a player sees themselves in the burnout ending or reflects on how often they scroll before bed, then the game did its job. I hope this project encourages players to think twice not just about their screen time, but about how they use their energy and what they’re trading for temporary distraction.</p>
