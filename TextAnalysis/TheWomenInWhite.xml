        <body>
<p>It was the last day of July. The long hot summer was drawing to
a close; and we, the <emotion>weary</emotion> pilgrims of the <place name="London">London</place> pavement, were
beginning to think of the cloud-shadows on the corn-fields, and the
autumn breezes on the sea-shore</p>

<p>For my own poor part, the fading summer left me out of health, out
of spirits, and, if the truth must be told, out of money as well.
During the past year I had not managed my professional resources as
carefully as usual; and my <definition>extravagance<definition> now limited me to the prospect
of spending the autumn economically between my <people>mother’s</people> cottage at
<place name="Hampstead">Hampstead</place> and my own chambers in town.</p>

<p>The evening, I remember, was still and cloudy; the <place name="London">London</place> air was
at its heaviest; the distant hum of the street-traffic was at its
faintest; the small <symbolism>pulse of the life</symbolism> within me, and the great heart of
the city around me, seemed to be sinking in unison, <definition>languidly</definition> and more
<definition>languidly</definition>, with the <symbolism>sinking sun</symbolism>. I roused myself from the book which I
was dreaming over rather than reading, and left my chambers to meet the
cool night air in the suburbs. It was one of the two evenings in every
week which I was accustomed to spend with my <people>mother</people> and my sister. So I
turned my steps northward in the direction of <place name="Hampstead">Hampstead</place>.</p>

<p>Events which I have yet to relate make it necessary to mention in this
place that my father had been dead some years at the period of which I
am now writing; and that my sister <people>Sarah</people> and I were the sole survivors
of a <theme>family</theme> of five children. My father was a drawing-master before
me. His exertions had made him highly successful in his profession;
and his affectionate anxiety to provide for the future of those who
were dependent on his labours had impelled him, from the time of his
marriage, to devote to the insuring of his life a much larger portion
of his income than most men consider it necessary to set aside for that
purpose. Thanks to his admirable prudence and self-denial my <people>mother</people>and
sister were left, after his death, as independent of the world as they
had been during his <theme>lifetime</theme>. I succeeded to his connection, and had
every reason to feel <emotion>grateful</emotion> for the prospect that awaited me at my
starting in life.</p>

<p>The quiet twilight was still trembling on the topmost ridges of the
heath; and the view of <place name="London">London</place> below me had sunk into a black gulf in
the shadow of the cloudy night, when I stood before the gate of my
<people>mother’s</people> cottage. I had hardly rung the bell before the house door was
opened violently; my worthy Italian friend, Professor <people>Pesca</people>, appeared
in the servant’s place; and darted out joyously to receive me, with a
shrill foreign parody on an English cheer.</p>

<p>On his own account, and, I must be allowed to add, on mine also, the
Professor merits the honour of a formal introduction. Accident has made
him the starting-point of the strange <theme>family</theme> story which it is the
purpose of these pages to unfold.</p>

<p>I had first become acquainted with my Italian friend by meeting him
at certain great houses where he taught his own language and I taught
drawing. All I then knew of the history of his life was, that he had
once held a situation in the University of Padua; that he had left
Italy for political reasons (the nature of which he uniformly declined
to mention to any one); and that he had been for many years respectably
established in <place name="London">London</place> as a teacher of languages.</p>

<p>Without being actually a dwarf—for he was perfectly well proportioned
from head to foot—<people>Pesca</people> was, I think, the smallest human being I
ever saw out of a show-room. Remarkable anywhere, by his personal
appearance, he was still further distinguished among the rank and
file of mankind by the harmless eccentricity of his character. The
ruling idea of his life appeared to be, that he was bound to show his
gratitude to the country which had afforded him an asylum and a means
of subsistence by doing his utmost to turn himself into an Englishman.
Not content with paying the nation in general the compliment of
invariably carrying an umbrella, and invariably wearing gaiters and a
white hat, the Professor further aspired to become an Englishman in his
habits and amusements, as well as in his personal appearance. Finding
us distinguished, as a nation, by our love of athletic exercises, the
little man, in the innocence of his heart, devoted himself impromptu
to all our English sports and <theme>pastimes</theme> whenever he had the opportunity
of joining them; firmly persuaded that he could adopt our national
amusements of the field by an effort of will precisely as he had
adopted our national gaiters and our national white hat.</p>

 <line>cricket-field; and soon afterwards I saw him risk his life, just as
blindly, in the sea at Brighton.</line>

<p>We had met there accidentally, and were bathing together. If we had
been engaged in any exercise peculiar to my own nation I should, of
course, have looked after <people>Pesca</people> carefully; but as foreigners are
generally quite as well able to take care of themselves in the water
as Englishmen, it never occurred to me that the art of swimming might
merely add one more to the list of manly exercises which the Professor
believed that he could learn impromptu. Soon after we had both struck
out from shore, I stopped, finding my friend did not gain on me, and
turned round to look for him. To my horror and amazement, I saw nothing
between me and the beach but two little white arms which struggled
for an instant above the surface of the water, and then disappeared
from view. When I dived for him, the poor little man was lying quietly
coiled up at the bottom, in a hollow of shingle, looking by many
degrees smaller than I had ever seen him look before. During the few
minutes that elapsed while I was taking him in, the air revived him,
and he ascended the steps of the machine with my assistance. With the
partial recovery of his animation came the return of his wonderful
delusion on the subject of swimming. As soon as his chattering teeth
would let him speak, he smiled vacantly, and said he thought it must
have been the Cramp.</p>

<p>When he had thoroughly recovered himself, and had joined me on the
beach, his warm Southern nature broke through all artificial English
restraints in a moment. He overwhelmed me with the wildest expressions
of affection—exclaimed passionately, in his exaggerated Italian way,
that he would hold his life henceforth at my disposal—and declared
that he should never be happy again until he had found an opportunity
of proving his gratitude by rendering me some service which I might
remember, on my side, to the end of my days.</p>

<p>I did my best to stop the torrent of his tears and protestations by
persisting in treating the whole adventure as a good subject for a
joke; and succeeded at last, as I imagined, in lessening <people>Pesca’s</people>
overwhelming sense of obligation to me. Little did I think then—little
did I think afterwards when our pleasant holiday had drawn to an
end—that the opportunity of serving me for which my <emotion>grateful</emotion> companion
so ardently longed was soon to come; that he was eagerly to seize it on
the instant; and that by so doing he was to turn the whole current of
my existence into a new channel, and to alter me to myself almost past
recognition.</p>

<p>Yet so it was. If I had not dived for Professor <people>Pesca</people> when he lay under
water on his shingle <object>bed</object>, I should in all human probability never have
been connected with the story which these pages will relate—I should
never, perhaps, have heard even the name of the woman who has lived in
all my thoughts, who has possessed herself of all my energies, who has
become the one guiding influence that now directs the purpose of my
life.</p>

III

<p><people>Pesca’s</people> face and manner, on the evening when we confronted each other
at my <people>mother’s</people> gate, were more than sufficient to inform me that
something extraordinary had happened. It was quite useless, however, to
ask him for an immediate explanation. I could only conjecture, while he
was dragging me in by both hands, that (knowing my habits) he had come
to the cottage to make sure of meeting me that night, and that he had
some news to tell of an unusually agreeable kind.</p>

<p>We both bounced into the parlour in a highly abrupt and undignified
manner. My <people>mother</people> sat by the open window laughing and fanning
herself. <people>Pesca</people> was one of her especial favourites and his wildest
eccentricities were always pardonable in her eyes. Poor dear soul!
from the first moment when she found out that the little Professor was
deeply and <emotion>gratefully</emotion> attached to her son, she opened her heart to
him unreservedly, and took all his puzzling foreign peculiarities for
granted, without so much as attempting to understand any one of them.</p>

<p>My sister <people>Sarah</people>, with all the advantages of youth, was, strangely
enough, less pliable. She did full justice to <people>Pesca’s</people> excellent
qualities of heart; but she could not accept him implicitly, as my
<people>other accepted him, for my sake. Her insular notions of propriety
rose in perpetual revolt against <people>Pesca’s</people> constitutional contempt for
appearances; and she was always more or less undisguisedly astonished
at her <people>mother’s</people> familiarity with the eccentric little foreigner. I
have observed, not only in my sister’s case, but in the instances of
others, that we of the young generation are nothing like so hearty
and so impulsive as some of our elders. I constantly see old people
flushed and excited by the prospect of some anticipated pleasure
which altogether fails to ruffle the tranquillity of their serene
grandchildren. Are we, I wonder, quite such genuine boys and girls now
as our seniors were in their time? Has the great advance in education
taken rather too long a stride; and are we in these modern days, just
the least trifle in the world too well brought up?</p>

<p>Without attempting to answer those questions decisively, I may at least
record that I never saw my <people>mother</people> and my sister together in <people>Pesca’s</people>
society, without finding my <people>mother</people> much the younger woman of the two.
On this occasion, for example, while the old lady was laughing heartily
over the boyish manner in which we tumbled into the parlour, <people>Sarah</people>
was perturbedly picking up the broken pieces of a teacup, which the
Professor had knocked off the table in his precipitate advance to meet
me at the door.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what would have happened, Walter,” said my <people>mother</people>, “if
you had delayed much longer. <people>Pesca</people> has been half mad with impatience,
and I have been half mad with curiosity. The Professor has brought some
wonderful news with him, in which he says you are concerned; and he
has cruelly refused to give us the smallest hint of it till his friend
Walter appeared.”</p>

 <line>“Very provoking: it spoils the Set,” murmured <people>Sarah</people> to herself,
mournfully absorbed over the ruins of the broken cup.</line>

<p>While these words were being spoken, <people>Pesca</people, happily and fussily
unconscious of the irreparable wrong which the crockery had suffered
at his hands, was dragging a large arm-chair to the opposite end of
the room, so as to command us all three, in the character of a public
speaker addressing an audience. Having turned the chair with its back
towards us, he jumped into it on his knees, and excitedly addressed his
small congregation of three from an impromptu pulpit.</p>

<p>“Now, my good dears,” began <people>Pesca</people> (who always said “good dears” when he
meant “worthy friends”), “listen to me. The time has come—I recite my
good news—I speak at last.”</p>

 <line>“The next thing he will break, mamma,” whispered <people>Sarah</people>, “will be the
back of the best arm-chair.”</line>

<p>“I go back into my life, and I address myself to the noblest of created
beings,” continued <people>Pesca</people>, vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self
over the top rail of the chair. “Who found me dead at the bottom of the
sea (through Cramp); and who pulled me up to the top; and what did I
say when I got into my own life and my own clothes again?”</p>

<p>“Much more than was at all necessary,” I answered as doggedly as
possible; for the least encouragement in connection with this subject
invariably let loose the Professor’s emotions in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>“I said,” persisted <people>Pesca</people>, “that my life belonged to my dear friend,
Walter, for the rest of my days—and so it does. I said that I should
never be happy again till I had found the opportunity of doing a good
Something for Walter—and I have never been contented with myself till
this most blessed day. Now,” cried the enthusiastic little man at the
top of his voice, “the overflowing happiness bursts out of me at every
pore of my skin, like a perspiration; for on my faith, and soul, and
honour, the something is done at last, and the only word to say now
is—Right-all-right!”</p>

<p>It may be necessary to explain here that <people>Pesca</people> prided himself on being
a perfect Englishman in his language, as well as in his dress, manners,
and amusements. Having picked up a few of our most familiar colloquial
expressions, he scattered them about over his conversation whenever
they happened to occur to him, turning them, in his high relish for
their sound and his general ignorance of their sense, into compound
words and repetitions of his own, and always running them into each
other, as if they consisted of one long syllable.</p>

<p>“Among the fine <place name="London">London</place> Houses where I teach the language of my
native country,” said the Professor, rushing into his long-deferred
explanation without another word of preface, “there is one, mighty
fine, in the big place called Portland. You all know where that is?
Yes, yes—course-of-course. The fine house, my good dears, has got
inside it a fine <theme>family</theme>. A Mamma, fair and fat; three young Misses,
fair and fat; two young Misters, fair and fat; and a Papa, the fairest
and the fattest of all, who is a mighty merchant, up to his eyes in
gold—a fine man once, but seeing that he has got a naked head and
two chins, fine no longer at the <theme>present time</theme>. Now mind! I teach the
sublime Dante to the young Misses, and ah!—my-soul-bless-my-soul!—it is
not in human language to say how the sublime Dante puzzles the pretty
heads of all three! No matter—all in good time—and the more lessons the
better for me. Now mind! Imagine to yourselves that I am teaching the
young Misses to-day, as usual. We are all four of us down together in
the Hell of Dante. At the Seventh Circle—but no matter for that: all
the Circles are alike to the three young Misses, fair and fat,—at the
Seventh Circle, nevertheless, my pupils are sticking fast; and I, to
set them going again, recite, explain, and blow myself up red-hot with
useless enthusiasm, when—a creak of boots in the passage outside, and
in comes the golden Papa, the mighty merchant with the naked head and
the two chins.—Ha! my good dears, I am closer than you think for to
the business, now. Have you been patient so far? or have you said to
yourselves, ‘Deuce-what-the-deuce! <people>Pesca<people>is long-winded to-night?’”</p>

 <line>We declared that we were deeply interested. The Professor went on:</line>

<p>“In his hand, the golden Papa has a letter; and after he has made
his excuse for disturbing us in our Infernal Region with the common
mortal Business of the house, he addresses himself to the three young
Misses, and begins, as you English begin everything in this blessed
world that you have to say, with a great O. ‘O, my dears,’ says the
mighty merchant, ‘I have got here a letter from my friend, Mr.——‘(the
name has slipped out of my mind; but no matter; we shall come back
to that; yes, yes—right-all-right). So the Papa says, ‘I have got
a letter from my friend, the Mister; and he wants a recommend from
me, of a drawing-master, to go down to his house in the country.’
My-soul-bless-my-soul! when I heard the golden Papa say those words,
if I had been big enough to reach up to him, I should have put my arms
round his neck, and pressed him to my bosom in a long and <emotion>grateful</emotion>
hug! As it was, I only bounced upon my chair. My seat was on thorns,
and my soul was on fire to speak but I held my tongue, and let Papa
go on. ‘Perhaps you know,’ says this good man of money, twiddling
his friend’s letter this way and that, in his golden fingers and
thumbs, ‘perhaps you know, my dears, of a drawing-master that I can
recommend?’ The three young Misses all look at each other, and then
say (with the indispensable great O to begin) “O, dear no, Papa! But
here is Mr. <people>Pesca<people>——’ At the mention of myself I can hold no longer—the
thought of you, my good dears, mounts like blood to my head—I start
from my seat, as if a spike had grown up from the ground through the
bottom of my chair—I address myself to the mighty merchant, and I say
(English phrase) ‘Dear sir, I have the man! The first and foremost
drawing-master of the world! Recommend him by the post to-night,
and send him off, bag and baggage (English phrase again—ha!), send
him off, bag and baggage, by the train to-morrow!’ ‘Stop, stop,’
says Papa; ‘is he a foreigner, or an Englishman?’ ‘English to the
bone of his back,’ I answer. ‘Respectable?’ says Papa. ‘Sir,’ I say
(for this last question of his outrages me, and I have done being
familiar with him—) ‘Sir! the immortal fire of genius burns in this
Englishman’s bosom, and, what is more, his father had it before him!’
‘Never mind,’ says the golden barbarian of a Papa, ‘never mind about
his genius, Mr. <people>Pesca</people>. We don’t want genius in this country, unless
it is accompanied by respectability—and then we are very glad to have
it, very glad indeed. Can your friend produce testimonials—letters
that speak to his character?’ I wave my hand negligently. ‘Letters?’
I say. ‘Ha! my-soul-bless-my-soul! I should think so, indeed! Volumes
of letters and portfolios of testimonials, if you like!’ ‘One or two
will do,’ says this man of phlegm and money. ‘Let him send them to
me, with his name and address. And—stop, stop, Mr. <people>Pesca</people>—before you
go to your friend, you had better take a note.’ ‘Bank-note!’ I say,
indignantly. ‘No bank-note, if you please, till my brave Englishman has
earned it first.’ ‘Bank-note!’ says Papa, in a great surprise, ‘who
talked of bank-note? I mean a note of the terms—a memorandum of what
he is expected to do. Go on with your lesson, Mr. <people>Pesca</people>, and I will
give you the necessary extract from my friend’s letter.’ Down sits
the man of merchandise and money to his pen, ink, and paper; and down
I go once again into the Hell of Dante, with my three young Misses
after me. In ten minutes’ <theme>time</theme> the note is written, and the boots of
Papa are creaking themselves away in the passage outside. From that
moment, on my faith, and soul, and honour, I know nothing more! The
glorious thought that I have caught my opportunity at last, and that
my <emotion>grateful</emotion> service for my dearest friend in the world is as good as
done already, flies up into my head and makes me drunk. How I pull
my young Misses and myself out of our Infernal Region again, how my
other business is done afterwards, how my little bit of dinner slides
itself down my throat, I know no more than a man in the moon. Enough
for me, that here I am, with the mighty merchant’s note in my hand,
as large as life, as hot as fire, and as happy as a king! Ha! ha! ha!
right-right-right-all-right!” Here the Professor waved the memorandum
of terms over his head, and ended his long and voluble narrative with
his shrill Italian parody on an English cheer.</p>

<p>My <people>mother</people> rose the moment he had done, with flushed cheeks and
brightened eyes. She caught the little man warmly by both hands.</p>

<p>“My dear, good <people>Pesca</people>,” she said, “I never doubted your true affection
for Walter—but I am more than ever persuaded of it now!”</p>

<p>“I am sure we are very much obliged to Professor <people>Pesca</people>, for Walter’s
sake,” added <people>Sarah</people>. She half rose, while she spoke, as if to approach
the arm-chair, in her turn; but, observing that <people>Pesca</people> was rapturously
kissing my <people>mother’s</people> hands, looked serious, and resumed her seat. “If
the familiar little man treats my <people>mother</people> in that way, how will he
treat ME?” Faces sometimes tell truth; and that was unquestionably the
thought in <people>Sarah’s</people> mind, as she sat down again.</p>

<p>Although I myself was <emotion>gratefully</emotion> sensible of the kindness of <people>Pesca’s</people>
motives, my spirits were hardly so much elevated as they ought to have
been by the prospect of future employment now placed before me. When
the Professor had quite done with my <people>mother’s</people> hand, and when I had
warmly thanked him for his interference on my behalf, I asked to be
allowed to look at the note of terms which his respectable patron had
drawn up for my inspection.</p>

 <line>“Read!” said the little man majestically. “I promise you my friend, the
writing of the golden Papa speaks with a tongue of trumpets for itself.”</line>

<p>The note of terms was plain, straightforward, and comprehensive, at any
rate. It informed me.</p>

<p>First, That Frederick Fairlie, Esquire, of Limmeridge House
Cumberland, wanted to engage the services of a thoroughly competent
drawing-master, for a period of four months certain.</p>

<p>Secondly, That the duties which the master was expected to perform
would be of a twofold kind. He was to superintend the instruction of
two young ladies in the art of painting in water-colours; and he was to
devote his leisure <theme>time</theme>, afterwards, to the business of repairing and
mounting a valuable collection of drawings, which had been suffered to
fall into a condition of total neglect.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That the terms offered to the person who should undertake and
properly perform these duties were four guineas a week; that he was to
reside at Limmeridge House; and that he was to be treated there on the
footing of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Fourthly, and lastly, That no person need think of applying for this
situation unless he could furnish the most unexceptionable references
to character and abilities. The references were to be sent to Mr.
Fairlie’s friend in <place name="London">London</place>, who was empowered to conclude all necessary
arrangements. These instructions were followed by the name and
address of <people>Pesca’s</people> employer in Portland Place—and there the note, or
memorandum, ended.</p>

<p>The prospect which this offer of an engagement held out was certainly
an attractive one. The employment was likely to be both easy and
agreeable; it was proposed to me at the autumn <theme>time</theme> of the year when I
was least occupied; and the terms, judging by my personal experience in
my profession, were surprisingly liberal. I knew this; I knew that I
ought to consider myself very fortunate if I succeeded in securing the
offered employment—and yet, no sooner had I read the memorandum than I
felt an inexplicable unwillingness within me to stir in the matter. I
had never in the whole of my previous experience found my duty and my
inclination so painfully and so unaccountably at variance as I found
them now.</p>

<line>“Oh, Walter, your father never had such a chance as this!” said my
<people>mother</people>, when she had read the note of terms and had handed it back to
me.</line>

 <line>“Such distinguished people to know,” remarked <people>Sarah</people>, straightening
herself in the chair; “and on such gratifying terms of equality too!”</line>

 <line>impatiently. “But before I send in my testimonials, I should like a
little time to consider——”</line>

 <line>“Consider!” exclaimed my <people>mother</people>. “Why, Walter, what is the matter with
you?”</line>

 <line>“Consider!” echoed my sister. “What a very extraordinary thing to say,
under the circumstances!”</line>

<p>“Consider!” chimed in the Professor. “What is there to consider about?
Answer me this! Have you not been complaining of your health, and have
you not been longing for what you call a smack of the country breeze?
Well! there in your hand is the paper that offers you perpetual choking
mouthfuls of country breeze for four months’ <theme>time</theme>. Is it not so? Ha!
Again—you want money. Well! Is four golden guineas a week nothing?
My-soul-bless-my-soul! only give it to me—and my boots shall creak like
the golden Papa’s, with a sense of the overpowering richness of the
man who walks in them! Four guineas a week, and, more than that, the
charming society of two young misses! and, more than that, your <object>bed</object>,
your breakfast, your dinner, your gorging English teas and lunches
and drinks of foaming beer, all for nothing—why, Walter, my dear good
friend—deuce-what-the-deuce!—for the first time in my life I have not
eyes enough in my head to look, and wonder at you!”</p>

<p>Neither my <people>mother’s</people> evident astonishment at my behaviour, nor <people>Pesca’s</people>
fervid enumeration of the advantages offered to me by the new
employment, had any effect in shaking my unreasonable disinclination to
go to Limmeridge House. After starting all the petty objections that I
could think of to going to Cumberland, and after hearing them answered,
one after another, to my own complete discomfiture, I tried to set up a
last obstacle by asking what was to become of my pupils in <place name="London">London</place> while
I was teaching Mr. Fairlie’s young ladies to sketch from nature. The
obvious answer to this was, that the greater part of them would be away
on their autumn travels, and that the few who remained at home might be
confided to the care of one of my brother drawing-masters, whose pupils
I had once taken off his hands under similar circumstances. My sister
reminded me that this gentleman had expressly placed his services at my
disposal, during the present season, in case I wished to leave town;
my <people>mother</people> seriously appealed to me not to let an idle caprice stand
in the way of my own interests and my own health; and <people>Pesca</people> piteously
entreated that I would not wound him to the heart by rejecting the
first <emotion>grateful</emotion> offer of service that he had been able to make to the
friend who had saved his life.</p>

<p>The evident sincerity and affection which inspired these remonstrances
would have influenced any man with an atom of good feeling in
his composition. Though I could not conquer my own unaccountable
perversity, I had at least virtue enough to be heartily ashamed of it,
and to end the discussion pleasantly by giving way, and promising to do
all that was wanted of me.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed merrily enough in humorous anticipations
of my coming life with the two young ladies in Cumberland. <people>Pesca</people>,
inspired by our national grog, which appeared to get into his head, in
the most marvellous manner, five minutes after it had gone down his
throat, asserted his claims to be considered a complete Englishman by
making a series of speeches in rapid succession, proposing my <people>mother’s</people>
health, my sister’s health, my health, and the healths, in mass, of
Mr. Fairlie and the two young Misses, pathetically returning thanks
himself, immediately afterwards, for the whole party. “A secret,
Walter,” said my little friend confidentially, as we walked home
together. “I am flushed by the recollection of my own eloquence. My
soul bursts itself with ambition. One of these days I go into your
noble Parliament. It is the dream of my whole life to be Honourable
<people>Pesca</people>, M.P.!”</p>

<p>The next morning I sent my testimonials to the Professor’s employer
in Portland Place. Three days passed, and I concluded, with secret
satisfaction, that my papers had not been found sufficiently explicit.
On the fourth day, however, an answer came. It announced that Mr.
Fairlie accepted my services, and requested me to start for Cumberland
immediately. All the necessary instructions for my journey were
carefully and clearly added in a postscript.</p>

<p>I made my arrangements, unwillingly enough, for leaving <place name="London">London</place> early
the next day. Towards evening <people>Pesca</people> looked in, on his way to a
dinner-party, to bid me good-bye.</p>

<p>“I shall dry my tears in your absence,” said the Professor gaily, “with
this glorious thought. It is my auspicious hand that has given the
first push to your fortune in the world. Go, my friend! When your sun
shines in Cumberland (English proverb), in the name of heaven make your
hay. Marry one of the two young Misses; become Honourable Hartright,
M.P.; and when you are on the top of the ladder remember that<people>Pesca</people>, at
the bottom, has done it all!”</p>

<p>I tried to laugh with my little friend over his parting jest, but
my spirits were not to be commanded. Something jarred in me almost
painfully while he was speaking his light farewell words.</p>

<p>When I was left alone again nothing remained to be done but to walk to
the <place name="Hampstead">Hampstead</place> cottage and bid my <people>mother</people> and <people>Sarah</people> good-bye.</p>

IV

The heat had been painfully oppressive all day, and it was now a close
and sultry night.

<p>My <people>mother</people> and sister had spoken so many last words, and had begged me
to wait another five minutes so many times, that it was nearly midnight
when the servant locked the garden-gate behind me. I walked forward
a few paces on the shortest way back to <place name="London">London</place>, then stopped and
hesitated.</p>


<p>The moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky, and the
broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light
to be hundreds of miles away from the great city that lay beneath it.
The idea of descending any sooner than I could help into the heat and
gloom of <place name="London">London</place> repelled me. The prospect of going to <object>bed</object> in my airless
chambers, and the prospect of gradual suffocation, seemed, in my
present restless frame of mind and body, to be one and the same thing.
I determined to stroll home in the purer air by the most roundabout
way I could take; to follow the white winding paths across the lonely
heath; and to approach <place name="London">London</place> through its most open suburb by striking
into the Finchley Road, and so getting back, in the cool of the new
morning, by the western side of the Regent’s Park.</p>

<p>I wound my way down slowly over the heath, enjoying the divine
stillness of the scene, and admiring the soft alternations of light
and shade as they followed each other over the broken ground on
every side of me. So long as I was proceeding through this first and
prettiest part of my night walk my mind remained passively open to
the impressions produced by the view; and I thought but little on any
subject—indeed, so far as my own sensations were concerned, I can
hardly say that I thought at all.</p>

<p>But when I had left the heath and had turned into the by-road,
where there was less to see, the ideas naturally engendered by the
approaching change in my habits and occupations gradually drew more
and more of my attention exclusively to themselves. By the time I had
arrived at the end of the road I had become completely absorbed in my
own fanciful visions of Limmeridge House, of Mr. Fairlie, and of the
two ladies whose practice in the art of water-colour painting I was so
soon to superintend.</p>

<p>I had now arrived at that particular point of my walk where four roads
met—the road to <place name="Hampstead">Hampstead</place>, along which I had returned, the road to
Finchley, the road to West End, and the road back to <place name="London">London</place>. I had
mechanically turned in this latter direction, and was strolling along
the lonely high-road—idly wondering, I remember, what the Cumberland
young ladies would look like—when, in one moment, every drop of blood
in my body was brought to a stop by the touch of a hand laid lightly
and suddenly on my shoulder from behind me.</p>

 <line>I turned on the instant, with my fingers tightening round the handle of
my stick.</line>

<p>There, in the middle of the broad bright high-road—there, as if it had
that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven—stood
the figure of a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white
garments, her face bent in grave inquiry on mine, her hand pointing to
the dark cloud over <place name="London">London</place>, as I faced her.</p>

<p>I was far too seriously startled by the suddenness with which this
extraordinary apparition stood before me, in the dead of night and in
that lonely place, to ask what she wanted. The strange woman spoke
first.</p>

 <line>“Is that the road to <place name="London">London</place>?” she said.</line>

<p>I looked attentively at her, as she put that singular question to me.
It was then nearly one o’clock. All I could discern distinctly by the
moonlight was a colourless, youthful face, meagre and sharp to look
at about the cheeks and chin; large, grave, wistfully attentive eyes;
nervous, uncertain lips; and light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow
hue. There was nothing wild, nothing immodest in her manner: it was
quiet and self-controlled, a little <definition>melancholy</definition> and a little touched by
suspicion; not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at the same time,
not the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life. The voice,
little as I had yet heard of it, had something curiously still and
mechanical in its tones, and the utterance was remarkably rapid. She
held a small bag in her hand: and her dress—bonnet, shawl, and gown all
of white—was, so far as I could guess, certainly not composed of very
delicate or very expensive materials. Her figure was slight, and rather
above the average height—her gait and actions free from the slightest
approach to extravagance. This was all that I could observe of her
in the dim light and under the perplexingly strange circumstances of
our meeting. What sort of a woman she was, and how she came to be out
alone in the high-road, an hour after midnight, I altogether failed to
guess. The one thing of which I felt certain was, that the grossest of
mankind could not have misconstrued her motive in speaking, even at
that suspiciously late hour and in that suspiciously lonely place.</p>

<p>“Did you hear me?” she said, still quietly and rapidly, and without
the least fretfulness or impatience. “I asked if that was the way to
<place name="London">London</place>.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “that is the way: it leads to St. John’s Wood and
the Regent’s Park. You must excuse my not answering you before. I was
rather startled by your sudden appearance in the road; and I am, even
now, quite unable to account for it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suspect me of doing anything wrong, do you? I have done
nothing wrong. I have met with an accident—I am very unfortunate in
being here alone so late. Why do you suspect me of doing wrong?”</p>

<p>She spoke with unnecessary earnestness and agitation, and shrank back
from me several paces. I did my best to reassure her.</p>

<p>“Pray don’t suppose that I have any idea of suspecting you,” I said,
“or any other wish than to be of assistance to you, if I can. I only
wondered at your appearance in the road, because it seemed to me to be
empty the instant before I saw you.”</p>

 <p>She turned, and pointed back to a place at the junction of the road to
<place name="London">London</place> and the road to <place name="Hampstead">Hampstead</place>, where there was a gap in the hedge.</line>

<p>“I heard you coming,” she said, “and hid there to see what sort of man
you were, before I risked speaking. I doubted and feared about it till
you passed; and then I was obliged to steal after you, and touch you.”</p>

 <p>Steal after me and touch me? Why not call to me? Strange, to say the
least of it.</p>

<p>“May I trust you?” she asked. “You don’t think the worse of me because
I have met with an accident?” She stopped in confusion; shifted her bag
from one hand to the other; and sighed bitterly.</p>

<p>The loneliness and helplessness of the woman touched me. The natural
impulse to assist her and to spare her got the better of the judgment,
the caution, the worldly tact, which an older, wiser, and colder man
might have summoned to help him in this strange emergency.</p>

<p>“You may trust me for any harmless purpose,” I said. “If it troubles
you to explain your strange situation to me, don’t think of returning
to the subject again. I have no right to ask you for any explanations.
Tell me how I can help you; and if I can, I will.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, and I am very, very thankful to have met you.” The
first touch of womanly tenderness that I had heard from her trembled in
her voice as she said the words; but no tears glistened in those large,
wistfully attentive eyes of hers, which were still fixed on me. “I have
only been in <place name="London">London</place> once before,” she went on, more and more rapidly,
“and I know nothing about that side of it, yonder. Can I get a fly, or
a carriage of any kind? Is it too late? I don’t know. If you could show
me where to get a fly—and if you will only promise not to interfere
with me, and to let me leave you, when and how I please—I have a friend
in <place name="London">London</place> who will be glad to receive me—I want nothing else—will you
promise?”</p>

<p>She looked anxiously up and down the road; shifted her bag again from
one hand to the other; repeated the words, “Will you promise?” and
looked hard in my face, with a pleading fear and confusion that it
troubled me to see.</p>

<p>What could I do? Here was a stranger utterly and helplessly at my
mercy—and that stranger a forlorn woman. No house was near; no one was
passing whom I could consult; and no earthly right existed on my part
to give me a power of control over her, even if I had known how to
exercise it. I trace these lines, self-distrustfully, with the shadows
of after-events darkening the very paper I write on; and still I say,
what could I do?</p>

<p>What I did do, was to try and gain time by questioning her. “Are you
sure that your friend in <place name="London">London</place> will receive you at such a late hour as
this?” I said.</p>

<p>“Quite sure. Only say you will let me leave you when and how I
please—only say you won’t interfere with me. Will you promise?”</line>

<p>As she repeated the words for the third time, she came close to me and
laid her hand, with a sudden gentle stealthiness, on my bosom—a thin
hand; a cold hand (when I removed it with mine) even on that sultry
night. Remember that I was young; remember that the hand which touched
me was a woman’s.</p>

 <p>“Will you promise?”</p>

 <p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>One word! The little familiar word that is on everybody’s lips, every
hour in the day. Oh me! and I tremble, now, when I write it.</line>

<p>We set our faces towards <place name="London">London</place>, and walked on together in the first
still hour of the new day—I, and this woman, whose name, whose
character, whose story, whose objects in life, whose very presence by
my side, at that moment, were fathomless mysteries to me. It was like
a dream. Was I Walter Hartright? Was this the well-known, uneventful
road, where holiday people strolled on Sundays? Had I really left,
little more than an hour since, the quiet, decent, conventionally
domestic atmosphere of my <people>mother’s</people> cottage? I was too bewildered—too
conscious also of a vague sense of something like self-reproach—to
speak to my strange companion for some minutes. It was her voice again
that first broke the silence between us.</p>

 <line>“I want to ask you something,” she said suddenly. “Do you know many
people in <place name="London">London</place>?”</line>

<line>“Yes, a great many.”</line>

<line>“Many men of rank and title?” There was an unmistakable tone of
suspicion in the strange question. I hesitated about answering it.</line>

 <line>“Some,” I said, after a moment’s silence.</line>

<line>“Many”—she came to a full stop, and looked me searchingly in the
face—“many men of the rank of Baronet?”</line>

 <line>Too much astonished to reply, I questioned her in my turn.</line>

 <line>“Why do you ask?”</line>

 <line>“Because I hope, for my own sake, there is one Baronet that you don’t
know.”</line>

 <line>“Will you tell me his name?”</line>

<p>“I can’t—I daren’t—I forget myself when I mention it.” She spoke loudly
and almost fiercely, raised her clenched hand in the air, and shook it
passionately; then, on a sudden, controlled herself again, and added,
in tones lowered to a whisper “Tell me which of them YOU know.”</p>

<p>I could hardly refuse to humour her in such a trifle, and I mentioned
three names. Two, the names of fathers of families whose daughters I
taught; one, the name of a bachelor who had once taken me a cruise in
his yacht, to make sketches for him.</p>

 <line>“Ah! you DON’T know him,” she said, with a sigh of relief. “Are you a
man of rank and title yourself?”</line>

 <line>“Far from it. I am only a drawing-master.”</line>

 <p>As the reply passed my lips—a little bitterly, perhaps—she took my arm
with the abruptness which characterised all her actions.</line>

 <line>“Not a man of rank and title,” she repeated to herself. “Thank God! I
may trust HIM.”</line>

<p>I had hitherto contrived to master my curiosity out of consideration
for my companion; but it got the better of me now.</line>

<p>“I am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank
and title?” I said. “I am afraid the baronet, whose name you are
unwilling to mention to me, has done you some grievous wrong? Is he the
cause of your being out here at this strange time of night?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me: don’t make me talk of it,” she answered. “I’m not fit
now. I have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged. You will be kinder
than ever, if you will walk on fast, and not speak to me. I sadly want
to quiet myself, if I can.”</p>

<p>We moved forward again at a quick pace; and for half an hour, at least,
not a word passed on either side. From <theme>time to time</theme>, being forbidden to
make any more inquiries, I stole a look at her face. It was always the
same; the lips close shut, the brow frowning, the eyes looking straight
forward, eagerly and yet absently. We had reached the first houses, and
were close on the new Wesleyan college, before her set features relaxed
and she spoke once more.</p>

 <line>“Do you live in <place name="London">London</place>?” she said.</line>

<p>“Yes.” As I answered, it struck me that she might have formed some
intention of appealing to me for assistance or advice, and that I ought
to spare her a possible disappointment by warning her of my approaching
absence from home. So I added, “But to-morrow I shall be away from
<place name="London">London</place> for some <theme>time</theme>. I am going into the country.”</p>

 <line>“Where?” she asked. “North or south?”</line>

 <line>“North—to Cumberland.”</line>

 <line>“Cumberland!” she repeated the word tenderly. “Ah! I wish I was going
there too. I was once happy in Cumberland.”</line>

 <line>I tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me.</line>

 <line>“Perhaps you were born,” I said, “in the beautiful Lake country.”</line>

<p>“No,” she answered. “I was born in Hampshire; but I once went to school
for a little while in Cumberland. Lakes? I don’t remember any lakes.
It’s Limmeridge village, and Limmeridge House, I should like to see
again.”</p>

<p>It was my turn now to stop suddenly. In the excited state of my
curiosity, at that moment, the chance reference to Mr. Fairlie’s place
of residence, on the lips of my strange companion, staggered me with
astonishment.</p>

 <p>“Did you hear anybody calling after us?” she asked, looking up and down
the road affrightedly, the instant I stopped.</line>

 <p>“No, no. I was only struck by the name of Limmeridge House. I heard it
mentioned by some Cumberland people a few days since.”</line>

<p>“Ah! not my people. Mrs. Fairlie is dead; and her husband is dead; and
their little girl may be married and gone away by this time. I can’t
say who lives at Limmeridge now. If any more are left there of that
name, I only know I love them for Mrs. Fairlie’s sake.”</p>

<p>She seemed about to say more; but while she was speaking, we came
within view of the turnpike, at the top of the Avenue Road. Her hand
tightened round my arm, and she looked anxiously at the gate before us.</p>

<p>“Is the turnpike man looking out?” she asked.</line>

<p>He was not looking out; no one else was near the place when we passed
through the gate. The sight of the gas-lamps and houses seemed to
agitate her, and to make her impatient.</p>

 <p>“This is <place name="London">London</place>,” she said. “Do you see any carriage I can get? I am
tired and frightened. I want to shut myself in and be driven away.”</line>

<p>I explained to her that we must walk a little further to get to a
<object>cab-stand</object>, unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty
vehicle; and then tried to resume the subject of Cumberland. It was
useless. That idea of shutting herself in, and being driven away,
had now got full possession of her mind. She could think and talk of
nothing else.</p>

<p>We had hardly proceeded a third of the way down the Avenue Road when I
saw a <object>cab</object> draw up at a house a few doors below us, on the opposite side
of the way. A gentleman got out and let himself in at the garden door.
I hailed the <object>cab</object>, as the driver mounted the box again. When we crossed
the road, my companion’s impatience increased to such an extent that
she almost forced me to run.</p>

<p>“It’s so late,” she said. “I am only in a hurry because it’s so late.”</line>

<p>“I can’t take you, sir, if you’re not going towards Tottenham Court
Road,” said the driver civilly, when I opened the <object>cab</object> door. “My horse
is dead beat, and I can’t get him no further than the stable.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. That will do for me. I’m going that way—I’m going that way.”
She spoke with breathless eagerness, and pressed by me into the <object>cab</object>.</p>

<p>I had assured myself that the man was sober as well as civil before
I let her enter the vehicle. And now, when she was seated inside, I
entreated her to let me see her set down safely at her destination.</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” she said vehemently. “I’m quite safe, and quite happy
now. If you are a gentleman, remember your promise. Let him drive on
till I stop him. Thank you—oh! thank you, thank you!”</p>

<p>My hand was on the <object>cab</object> door. She caught it in hers, kissed it, and
pushed it away. The <object>cab</object> drove off at the same moment—I started into
the road, with some vague idea of stopping it again, I hardly knew
why—hesitated from dread of frightening and distressing her—called,
at last, but not loudly enough to attract the driver’s attention. The
sound of the wheels grew fainter in the distance—the <object>cab</object> melted into
the black shadows on the road—the woman in white was gone.</p>

<p>Ten minutes or more had passed. I was still on the same side of the
way; now mechanically walking forward a few paces; now stopping again
absently. At one moment I found myself doubting the reality of my own
adventure; at another I was perplexed and distressed by an uneasy sense
of having done wrong, which yet left me confusedly ignorant of how
I could have done right. I hardly knew where I was going, or what I
meant to do next; I was conscious of nothing but the confusion of my
own thoughts, when I was abruptly recalled to myself—awakened, I might
almost say—by the sound of rapidly approaching wheels close behind me.</p>

<p>I was on the dark side of the road, in the thick shadow of some garden
trees, when I stopped to look round. On the opposite and lighter side
of the way, a short distance below me, a policeman was strolling along
in the direction of the Regent’s Park.</p>

 <line>The carriage passed me—an open chaise driven by two men.</line>

 <line>“Stop!” cried one. “There’s a policeman. Let’s ask him.”</line>

 <line>The horse was instantly pulled up, a few yards beyond the dark place
where I stood.</line>

 <line>“Policeman!” cried the first speaker. “Have you seen a woman pass this
way?”</line>

 <line>“What sort of woman, sir?”</line>

 <line>“A woman in a lavender-coloured gown——”</line>

  <line>“No, no,” interposed the second man. “The clothes we gave her were
found on her <object>bed</object>. She must have gone away in the clothes she wore when
she came to us. In white, policeman. A woman in white.”</line>

 <line>“I haven’t seen her, sir.”</line>

 <line>“If you or any of your men meet with the woman, stop her, and send her
in careful keeping to that address. I’ll pay all expenses, and a fair
reward into the bargain.”</line>

 <line>The policeman looked at the card that was handed down to him.</line>

 <line>“Why are we to stop her, sir? What has she done?”</line>

 <line>“Done! She has escaped from my Asylum. Don’t forget; a woman in white.
Drive on.”</line>
