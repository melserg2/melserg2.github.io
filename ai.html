  <h1>Rebuilding Elizabot</h1>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p> I have changed my Elizabot into a comedian bot named Witty. Instead of being an ordinary therapist, Witty is sarcastic, dramatic, and lives for the drama. The goal of this was to keep the Elizabot originality but also adding in gen z humor and witty comments. Witty is a bot that responds with jokes and sarcastic comments to keep a conversation entertaining and unpredictable. I rewrote the bots greeting and goodbye to match the witty comments and new tone. For example, instead of the bot asking about your day politely, it now says greeting like “Oh hey! Didn’t see ya there.” This adds a witty feel with some gen z words like “ya”. For the goodbyes, I changed the responses to be more humorous and funnier instead of making the goodbyes more casual. For example, "Goodbye.  It was nice talking to you, sort of." This ends the conversation with being witty and leaving you with comedic enjoyment. Following this, I also rewrote many phrases. The original bot “Elizabot” would normally offer reflective and gentle questions, whereas Witty now responds with playful mockery or exaggerated sympathy. For example, if a user says they are sad, Witty might say, “Yikes. Did something specific bring on the sad, or just vibes?” Also, to make it more gen z, I added some pop culture references. For example, “or is it just visiting your head rent-free?" This makes Witty more up to date and relatable which adds to the comedic effect. Lastly, after texting the new and improved bot, Witty has worked very well overall. The bot is very successful in keeping the conversation going with funny and unpredictable dialogue. Witty has adapted witty responses that fits the variety of what you put into the chat. </p>
